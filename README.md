Very simple pregnancy tracker.

You can either set a start date and the application will calculate the projected
birth date or vice versa.
The application states the current week, the current month, and the current day.
Additionally it gives a rough estimate of baby's current size and weights using
linear interpolation of the data from [babycenter.com](https://www.babycenter.com/average-fetal-length-weight-chart)
